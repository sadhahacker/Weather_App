# React App README

Welcome to the README for our React app! This document will guide you through the steps to set up and run the application on your local development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the React app, please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Node.js**: You need Node.js installed. You can download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **npm** or **Yarn**: Both npm (Node Package Manager) and Yarn are package managers for JavaScript. You can choose either one, but npm usually comes bundled with Node.js, so you should have it already. However, you can also install Yarn from [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/).
